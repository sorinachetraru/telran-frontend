    <h2>Body & Soul</h2>

    <h3>Train your body & heal your soul</h3>

    <p>
      Yoga is an ancient system of physical, mental and spiritual practices that
      have been passed down through the generations from teacher to student.
      Yogic practices include breathing techniques, postures, relaxation,
      chanting, and other meditation methods. There are many different styles of
      yoga, each with their own unique focus and approach to creating a unitive
      state.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals of Yoga</h3>

    <p>
      Yoga is a meditative process of self-discovery and liberation. It is a
      diverse collection of practices that aims to control the mind, recognize a
      detached witness consciousness, and free oneself from the cycle of birth
      and death. It teaches us to see ourselves clearly, to understand what is
      true about who we are, and to let go of anything that does not serve us.
      It helps us to become aware of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, and to
      change them when they no longer serve us. It gives us the tools to make
      better choices in life, and to live more fully. Yoga is a practice that
      allows us to transform and purify our bodies, minds, and souls. It expands
      our consciousness to help us connect with nature and the universe around
      us. It also gives us greater access to inner resources to teach us about
      self-awareness, acceptance, compassion, patience, gratitude, forgiveness,
      humility, love, peace, and joy.
